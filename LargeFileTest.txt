CSE 3000 Week 13 Reflec.on Worksheet Due on week 13
1. Are there benefits to giving up some of your privacy while using the internet or other compuing
technologies?
There are certainly benefits to giving up some of your privacy while using the internet or other computing technologies. Here are a few examples:
Personalized experiences: Many online services use data about your browsing history, interests, and location to provide personalized recommendations, advertising, and content. This can make your online experience more enjoyable and efficient.
Improved security: Some online services may use your personal information to verify your identity and prevent fraud. For example, your bank may require you to provide personal information to access your account online, which helps prevent unauthorized access.
Better healthcare: With the help of technology, medical professionals can access a wealth of information about patients, including their medical history and test results. This can help doctors make more informed decisions about treatment, leading to better health outcomes.
Convenience: By sharing some of your personal information, you can access a variety of online services quickly and easily. For example, you can use your social media account to log in to other websites without having to create a new account.

2. A common view is that if you have nothing to hide, then you have no serious need for privacy. This
view is captured well by the following quote from the article: "When asked during an interview about
whether users should share information with Google as if it were a ‘trusted friend’, the then CEO Eric
Schmidt famously responded, ‘If you have something that you don’t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place.'" (31) What are some of the reasons that Véliz thinks this claim is incorrect?
Privacy is a fundamental human right: Privacy is not just about hiding something, but it's also about having control over personal information and protecting oneself from unwanted surveillance. Privacy is a fundamental human right that allows individuals to maintain their autonomy and dignity.
Privacy is necessary for democracy: Privacy is essential for democracy because it allows individuals to form and express their opinions without fear of retaliation or persecution. Without privacy, people may be afraid to speak out against the government or powerful institutions.
Privacy is necessary for creativity and innovation: Privacy is also important for creativity and innovation because it allows individuals to explore new ideas and take risks without fear of judgment or criticism. This is especially important in fields such as science, art, and literature.

3. Another common view is that if you are not someone important then your privacy is more or less safe. What are some of Véliz's reasons for thinking that this is also incorrect?
Everyone has personal information that they want to keep private: Even if you are not a public figure or someone with a high profile, you still have personal information that you want to keep private, such as your financial information, health information, and communication with friends and family. This information can be valuable to hackers or other entities looking to exploit your personal data.

The value of personal data is increasing: With the rise of big data and the increasing use of algorithms and machine learning, personal data has become a valuable commodity. Companies and other entities can use personal data to make predictions about individual behavior and preferences, which can be used for marketing, political campaigns, and other purposes.
The scope of surveillance is expanding: Surveillance technology is becoming more advanced and accessible, making it easier for governments, corporations, and other entities to monitor individuals' activities and collect personal data. This means that even if you are not someone important, your personal data may still be collected and used without your knowledge or consent.

4. For Véliz, what is the difference between 'hard' and 'soW' power?
Hard power refers to the use of coercion and force to control others. Examples of hard power include military force, police actions, and other forms of direct control. Hard power is often associated with authoritarian regimes, and it can be used to suppress dissent and maintain control over a population.
Soft power, on the other hand, refers to the use of persuasion and influence to control others. Examples of soft power include advertising, public relations, and other forms of messaging that shape public opinion and behavior. Soft power is often associated with democratic societies, and it can be used to shape public opinion and promote certain values or beliefs.
Véliz argues that the collection and use of personal data is a form of soft power that can be used to exert control over individuals and society as a whole. When companies and other entities collect personal data, they are able to shape individuals' behavior and preferences through targeted advertising and other forms of messaging. This can be a powerful tool for influencing public opinion and behavior, and it can be used to promote certain values and beliefs.

5. What are some examples of tech companies using hard power to affect user's privacy?
Apple's battle with the FBI: In 2016, Apple refused to comply with a court order to unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters, citing concerns about user privacy and security. The FBI ultimately found a way to unlock the phone without Apple's help, but the case raised important questions about the balance between privacy and law enforcement.
Uber's use of "God View": In 2014, it was revealed that Uber had been using a tool called "God View" to track the real-time locations of its customers without their consent. The tool was also used to track the movements of journalists who were critical of the company. Uber ultimately settled with the Federal Trade Commission over the incident.
Facebook's data-sharing scandal: In 2018, it was revealed that Facebook had allowed the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to access the personal data of millions of users without their consent. The scandal sparked a public outcry and led to increased scrutiny of Facebook's data practices.
Google's Street View controversy: In 2010, it was revealed that Google's Street View cars had been collecting personal data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks as they drove around taking photos. The incident led to a multi-year investigation by regulators in multiple countries and resulted in significant fines for Google.
Overall, while many tech companies aim to protect user privacy, there have been instances where companies have used hard power to collect and use personal data without users' consent or knowledge. It is important for individuals to be aware of these risks and take steps to protect their privacy online.
6. What are some examples of tech companies using soW power on users?
Facebook's algorithms: Facebook's News Feed algorithm is designed to show users content that is most likely to keep them engaged and on the platform. This means that the algorithm can influence users' behavior by showing them content that reinforces their existing beliefs and preferences. It can also be used to promote certain values and ideas to a wide audience.
Google's search results: Google's search algorithm is designed to show users the most relevant and useful results for their queries. However, the algorithm can also be used to promote certain websites or ideas over others, which can shape users' opinions and beliefs.
Amazon's product recommendations: Amazon's recommendation algorithm is designed to show users products that they are most likely to be interested in buying. This can influence users' behavior by encouraging them to make purchases that they might not have otherwise considered.
7. Véliz argues that 'privacy is power'. According to Véliz, how does having more privacy as an individual give you more power?
Privacy is essential for autonomy: Privacy is essential for individuals to maintain their autonomy and control over their personal information. When individuals have control over their personal information, they are able to make informed decisions about how that information is used and who has access to it. This can give them more power to shape their lives according to their own preferences and values.
Privacy is essential for resisting oppression: Privacy is also important for resisting oppression and discrimination. When individuals are able to keep certain information private, they are able to protect themselves from surveillance and discrimination by those in power. This can give them more power to resist oppression and maintain their dignity.
Privacy is essential for creativity and innovation: Privacy is important for creativity and innovation because it allows individuals to explore new ideas and take risks without fear of judgment or criticism. When individuals have the freedom to experiment and take risks, they are able to generate new ideas and make important contributions to society.
Privacy is essential for building trust: Privacy is also important for building trust in institutions and relationships. When individuals are able to trust that their personal information will be kept private and secure, they are more likely to be willing to share that information and engage in meaningful relationships with others.

8. Véliz also argues that a democracy cannot function properly without its citizens having sufficient
privacy. What are some of her reasons for thinking this?
Privacy protects free speech: Privacy is essential for protecting free speech in a democracy. When individuals know that their private communications and activities are protected, they are more likely to speak out and share their opinions without fear of retaliation or persecution. This allows for a more robust and diverse public discourse.
Privacy protects minority rights: Privacy is also important for protecting the rights of minorities in a democracy. When individuals have privacy protections, they are able to engage in activities and form communities without fear of discrimination or persecution by those in power.
Privacy fosters individual autonomy: Privacy is essential for fostering individual autonomy in a democracy. When individuals have control over their personal information and the ability to keep certain aspects of their lives private, they are able to make informed decisions about their lives and pursue their goals without interference from others.
Privacy promotes transparency and accountability: Privacy is also important for promoting transparency and accountability in a democracy. When individuals have privacy protections, they are more likely to engage in public discourse and hold those in power accountable for their actions.

Overall, Véliz argues that privacy is essential for a healthy democracy because it protects free speech, minority rights, individual autonomy, and transparency and accountability. Without privacy protections, individuals may be afraid to speak out and engage in public discourse, leading to a less diverse and robust public sphere.

9. . Getting personalized content when online is often thought of as a benefit to giving up some of your privacy. However, Véliz sees at least some types of personalized content as being harmful for users and society. What issue does Véliz have with some personalized content? Do you think there is a way to keep. Carissa Véliz argues in her book "Privacy Is Power" that while personalized content can be beneficial in some cases, there are also types of personalized content that can be harmful for users and society. One of the key issues she has with personalized content is the potential for it to create filter bubbles and echo chambers.

Filter bubbles refer to the idea that when individuals receive personalized content, they are more likely to be exposed to information and viewpoints that reinforce their existing beliefs and preferences. This can lead to a distorted view of the world and prevent individuals from engaging with diverse perspectives and ideas.
Echo chambers are similar to filter bubbles but refer specifically to the social aspects of personalized content. When individuals receive personalized content, they may also be more likely to engage with others who share their beliefs and preferences. This can create echo chambers where individuals are only exposed to viewpoints that reinforce their existing beliefs and are less likely to engage with diverse perspectives and ideas.
Véliz argues that filter bubbles and echo chambers can be harmful for individuals and society because they can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy for others, and they can make it difficult to have meaningful public discourse and deliberation.
While personalized content can be beneficial in some cases, such as in healthcare or education, there may be ways to mitigate the potential harm caused by filter bubbles and echo chambers. For example, algorithms could be designed to promote diversity and expose users to a wider range of viewpoints and ideas. Additionally, individuals can take steps to diversify their own sources of information and engage with diverse perspectives and ideas.

10. In addition to arguing that privacy is related to power, she argues that there is something 'collective'about the nature of privacy. What are some of her reasons for thinking that privacy is collective?
Privacy protects society as a whole: Privacy is not just important for protecting individuals, but also for protecting society as a whole. When personal information is compromised, it can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other forms of harm that affect not just the individual, but also the wider community.
Privacy is necessary for democracy: Privacy is essential for democracy because it allows individuals to form and express their opinions without fear of retaliation or persecution. When individuals are free to speak their minds and engage in public discourse without fear of surveillance, it leads to a more robust and diverse public sphere.
Privacy is a public good: Privacy is a public good that benefits everyone, not just the individual. When personal information is kept private, it helps to prevent discrimination, protect individuals from harm,
